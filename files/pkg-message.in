Nix build users may be created by executing the "add-nixbld-users" script
(it is located in "%%DATADIR%%") and specifying
the desired number of build users as an argument.

For example:

%%DATADIR%%/add-nixbld-users 4

is going to create 4 nixbld users.

See https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ssec-multi-user for more details about
build users.
